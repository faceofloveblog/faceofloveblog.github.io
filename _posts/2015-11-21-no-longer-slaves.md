I found a song about a month ago that has been wrecking me - in a good way. I've been studying a lot about [abiding in God, and God abiding in me][0]. I've been learning about how fear gets in the way of my relationship with God and how [God's perfect love casts out my fears][1]. Of course, as shown in my previous posts, I've been feeling overwhelming freedom from shame.

This new song encompasses all of these things. The song is *No Longer Slaves* by [Bethel Music](https://bethelmusic.com/).

[Here][2] are the simple, yet powerful lyrics:

    Verse 1
    
    You unravel me, with a melody
    You surround me with a song
    Of deliverance, from my enemies
    Till all my fears are gone
    
    Chorus
    
    I.m no longer a slave to fear
    I am a child of God
    
    Verse 2
    
    From my Mothers womb
    You have chosen me
    Love has called my name
    I.ve been born again, into your family
    Your blood flows through my veins
    
    Interlude
    
    I am surrounded by the arms of the Father
    I am surrounded by songs of deliverance
    We've been liberated from our bondage
    We're the sons and the daughters
    Let us sing our freedom!
    
    Bridge
    
    You split the sea, so I could walk right through it
    All my fears were drowned in perfect love
    You rescued me, so I could stand and sing
    I am a child of God

There are so many parts that speak to me.

## "You surround me with a song"

This reminds me of [Zephaniah 3:17][3] - "The Lord your God is in your midst, A victorious warrior. He will exult over you with joy, He will be quiet in His love, He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy."

I love the picture of God surrounding me with a song!

## "Till all my fears are gone"

This reminds me of how thorough and [persistent][4] God is. It's not just that he takes away your fears - He sticks with it until _all_ my fears are gone.

## "I'm no longer a slave to fear"

Fear is enslaving - it prevents us from freely loving others, loving ourselves, and loving God. This is such an amazing encouragement - because of His perfect love which [drives out][5] all fear, I don't have to live under the power of fear - but can live free.

## "I am a child of God"

This is always hard for me to fathom. Not only would God send Jesus to _die_ for my sins, He adopts me into His family as His child. It seems like I always can use the reminder that God [calls me His child][6].

The last two lines of Verse 2 remind me of this as well: "I've been born again, into your family - your blood flows through my veins".

## "I am surrounded by the arms of the Father"

Being surrounded by the [arms of God][7] sounds like the safest place I could be. How can I have fear in the safest place - in the arms of the God who calls me His child!

## "We've been liberated from our bondage - Let us sing our freedom!"

Sometimes it is easy to forget the magnitude of God setting us free. But [Galatians 5:1][8] says - "It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery." How can we not sing out of the feeling that comes with being set free!

## "You split the sea so I could walk right through it"

To me, this line reaffirms that [Nothing is impossible with God][9]. This gives more reason to believe that we don't need to be slaves to sin. Putting your complete trust in God is scary: being [pinned up against the sea][10], [stepping out of the boat in stormy seas][11] - you only get through situations like that if God is in control.

## "All my fears were drowned in perfect love"

Again with the mention of fear being conquered by [perfect Love][12] - I love the mental picture of fear being drowned in perfect Love. Instead of being overwhelmed by fear you can imaging fear being overwhelmed by love.

## "You rescued me so I could stand and sing - I am a child of God"

Once again - the feeling of being set free - being rescued - that is indeed something to sing about!
