I just heard a new (to me) song that was released by [Lauren Daigle](http://laurendaigle.com/site/) called *How Can it Be*.

It seems like I have been finding a lot of songs recently that have been dealing with guilt or shame, or rather, the amazing forgiveness of God. The title of this song sums it up perfectly: "How can it be?" God's forgiveness doesn't make sense to me, and when I listen to this song it brings tears to my eyes - to hear someone vocalize the incredible forgiveness Jesus provided to me.

Here are the lyrics:

<pre>
<b>Verse 1</b>
I am guilty
Ashamed of what I've done, what I've become
These hands are dirty
I dare not lift them up to the Holy one

<b>Chorus</b>
You plead my cause
You right my wrongs
You break my chains
You overcome
You gave Your life
To give me mine
You say that I am free
How can it be
How can it be

<b>Verse 2</b>
I've been hiding
Afraid I've let you down, inside I doubt
That You still love me
But in Your eyes there's only grace now

<b>Bridge</b>
Though I fall, You can make me new
From this death I will rise with You
Oh the grace reaching out for me
How can it be
How can it be
</pre>
-------------------

The verses do such a great job of describing how I can feel dirty, guilty, and afraid that I let God down.  But the chorus and the bridge provide such a relief and amazement to me. How amazing that He makes me new. He calls me free! He gave His life to give me mine. ***How can it be***?
