I heard a new song by [Bethel Music](//bethelmusic.com) last week that quickly became my Easter song for 2016.  (It feels like I find a new song each year that is so fitting for celebrating Easter and I end up listening it multiple times over the Easter weekend.)

The song is called *[Son of God](//bethelmusic.com/publishing/son-of-god/)*.

Here are the lyrics:

<pre>
<b>Verse 1</b>
There is a place of sorrow and love
The innocent Savior broken and bleeding for us  
The nails in His hands and thorns on His brow
Rivers of mercy endlessly flowing down   

<b>Chorus</b>
The Son of God high and lifted up
The Father’s love came pouring down for us
He has overcome

The spotless Lamb for every sinner slain
Our victory, our hope beyond the grave
He has overcome

<b>Verse 2</b>
There is a place for all who would come
His arms are open, our sins are washed white in His blood    
The lost and unworthy come find your home
The broken and hurting, His love will never let go  

<b>Bridge</b>
Now my song will ever be
Of my Savior’s love for me
When at last His face I see
With all the saints in glory
</pre>

--------------------------

**Verse 1** paints such a vivid picture of what Jesus went through as He died on the cross for me.  I love the phrase "*Rivers of mercy endlessly flowing down*."  If you ever doubt that God could forgive *all* of your sin, just think about that line: *Rivers* of mercy *endlessly* flowing down... There is limit to His mercy - it is enough to cover *all* of your sin.

**Verse 2** continues that thought: when you feel lost and unworthy He just wants you to come home - His arms are open wide for you.  He has already washed your sins whiter than snow so you have nothing to be ashamed of - and His love will never let you go.

**The chorus** begins to transition into a celebration and exaltation of what God did for us.  The key phrase in the chorus "*He has overcome*" continues to reassure that your sin has been defeated and erased, replaced by God's love pouring down on you!

**The bridge** brings the song into full celebration because when you have been set free, forgiven, washed clean - all you want to do is shout and sing about God's love and look forward to being face to face with Love Himself!
