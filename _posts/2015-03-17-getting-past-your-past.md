Sometimes it is hard to let go of things you have done in your past and accept God's forgiveness. 

[1 John 1:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A7&version=NIV) (NIV) says "But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin." I'll repeat that last part: **Purifies** us from **all** sin.

Now this is going to be obvious, but the word pure makes me think that there are no blemishes left. And the word *all* doesn't give me the impression that some of them were left out when Jesus forgave my sins.

With that in mind, I stumbled upon a verse that really encourages me when I start thinking about the things I have done in my past:

[Genesis 50:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+50%3A20&version=NIV) (NIV) "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives."

The context of this verse is Joseph talking to his brothers who sold him into slavery. What they intended for harm, God intended for good - and used Joseph to save many lives.

It doesn't exactly relate to my situation because Joseph didn't do anything wrong, but the point that is encouraging to me is that God took something bad (something that was intended for harm) and used it for good - to save many lives.

If you are ashamed of something you did in the past (or maybe something you continue to do), just realize that God can use you for good - maybe even to help others!
