# Formalities

## Affiliate Links
Whenever I link to a book or a song, I will link to it on Amazon, with an affiliate link.  Any proceeds from the affiliate links will be donated to [Compassion](http://www.compassion.com/).

## Music

Any time I reference a song I will link to the song on Amazon (see above) and will try to embed the official YouTube video for the song if one can be found.  I will also try to link to the artist's web page if I can find it.

## Books

Any time I reference a book I will link to the book on Amazon (see above) and will try to link to the author's web page if I can find it.

## Advertising

Any time I mention a song, book, product, or website it is not because I was asked to mention it but because I was impacted by it in some way.

## Bible Verses

Any time I reference a Bible verse I will link to it on [Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/).  I use Bible Gateway out of preference and familiarity.
