## Who am I?

I am learning to be a better husband, a better father, and a better follower of Jesus.  I struggle with sin and shame but am constantly overwhelmed by the love of God and the fact that He chose to trade my sin for His righteousness.  I am unable to articulate the feeling of freedom that I feel as a result of the abundance of love and forgiveness that I receive from God.

## Why Blog?

This is really just an outlet for my thoughts.  Whenever I hear an amazing song, learn something new in the Bible, or hear something eye-opening in a sermon, I always want to share it with others.  This blog helps me process what I'm learning and may hopefully be an encouragement to others.
