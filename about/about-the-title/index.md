# About the Title
The title of this blog "The Face of Love" was inspired by the song "[Boldly I Approach (The Art of Celebration)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ISEF1LS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ISEF1LS&linkCode=as2&tag=viddvide-20&linkId=S5IQ56QRTJ6JACFC)" by [Rend Collective](http://rendcollective.com/).  There is a line in the song that says "I'm face to face with love Himself" - which is such an awesome visualization to me. 

I tend to think of His love as a thing or an idea, but as I John 4:8 says, "...God **is** love".  Imagining the beauty of God, who is love, makes it so much more powerful and real to me.  I love to imagine what it will be like to stand before God and be overwhelmed by His love - to stand "*face to face with love Himself*".
